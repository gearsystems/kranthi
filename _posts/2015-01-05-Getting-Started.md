Finally, the team kicked in to discuss on various aspects from finance to wireframes. Sunday went quite well designing wireframes with [Rajat](gearsystems.github.io/rajat) &amp; [Sudheesh](gearsystems.github.io/sudheesh).:stuck_out_tongue:

I have started working on Public Portal of GEAR Systems, one of the challenging tasks in the project. We chose python based `Django framework` to build our systems. :heart_eyes: 

Coding on Django is thought provoking and looks perfect and flawless for me. For the starters, I have installed few apps on Django, like `widget-tweaks` and `grappelli` for better templating and cool admin interface. I chose to change the admin interface as the default admin interface looks oldish. So,in a long run admin should not hesitate to visit the admin panel, hence I have integrated some cooler stuff to admin panel. I shall write about how things are done in Django in the coming posts.

The admin panel looks like this now.
![AdminPanel]({{site.url|append:site.baseurl}}/public/img/adminpanel.png)
:sunglasses:
We began developing custom authentication systems. ORM Feature and packed `contrib.auth` of Django makes life so easy. I have been working on writing models, forms and views for the authentication. It's almost complete. By next post, it would have long been done. Login and Signup forms are up and ready for now. Soon, social authentication systems like login with `facebook` or `twitter` or `google+` or `github` shall be added. We are also going to implement two factor authentication system.

With the onset of this project, I have a feeling like there will be legendary number of commits ahead and lot to learn, design and hack.:wink:

That's all for what I am upto today. Stay tuned for posts yet to come! :smile:
